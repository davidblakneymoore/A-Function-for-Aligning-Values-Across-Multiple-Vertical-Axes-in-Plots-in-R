# Aligning-a-Value-on-Primary-and-Secondary-Y-Axes-on-Plots-in-R

This repository contains a function for aligning values across primary and secondary y axes on a plot in R. This function returns new, rescaled axis limits for both the primary and the secondary y axis such that a particular value on the primary y axis and a particular value on the secondary y axis are aligned vertically. The user defines these two values to align. Though the example at the end of the R script uses base R plotting functions, these new axis limits can be used with plotting functions from any package.
